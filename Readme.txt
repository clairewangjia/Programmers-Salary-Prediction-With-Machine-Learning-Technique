Currently, programmer is one of the highest-paid job in China. We are curious about how their salary are distributed, higher salaries are determined by which type of attributes, for instance, personal qualifications like education and skills, company and job attributes like company scale and location.  Also, we try to make a prediction on the salary of different programmers in China. Several supervised learning models are adopted to solve this regression problem. 

Main targets of the project are as follows:

1.  Identifying individual qualifications as well as company attributes¡¯ effect on programmer¡¯s salary in China.

2.  Making robust prediction on individual salary based on machine learning algorithms.

3.  Comparing model performances
